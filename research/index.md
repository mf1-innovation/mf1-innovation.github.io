We conduct research to bridge the gap between life sciences and computer science, employing advanced sequencing technologies to analyze (meta-)genomic and transcriptomic datasets related to infectious diseases, immunology, and medical sciences. With this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to improve our understanding of pathogen-host interactions and support genomic surveillance and containment. 

Our research currently focuses on metagenomics, pangenomics, and wastewater surveillance in the context of infectious diseases and public health improvement.
