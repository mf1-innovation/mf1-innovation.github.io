# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Software

It is important to us that our bioinformatics research also leads to robust, easy-to-use and useful tools for the scientific community. Our tools are available open source and we use workflow management systems like Nextlow and containers like Docker to develop reproducible research software. Have fun trying them out and we're always happy to receive feedback and pull requests on GitHub.
